# Roadmap for Transitioning to Java/Spring Boot

This roadmap is designed to help a senior backend developer with experience in PHP/Laravel and Node.js/NestJS transition to becoming a mid-level backend developer in Java/Spring Boot within 2 months, dedicating 5 hours per week.

- **Topics:**
  - Building microservices with Spring Boot
  - Service communication using REST or messaging (RabbitMQ/Kafka)
  - Using Eureka for service discovery
- **Resources:**
  - Spring Cloud Documentation
- **Practical Tasks:**
  - Split the inventory system into two microservices (e.g., products and orders).

### **Week 7: Observability**

- **Objective:** Add monitoring and logging.
- **Topics:**
  - Centralized logging with Logback or Logstash
  - Metrics collection using Spring Boot Actuator
  - Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana
- **Resources:**
  - Spring Boot Actuator Guide
- **Practical Tasks:**
  - Integrate Actuator and set up basic monitoring for the inventory system.

### **Week 8: Deployment**

- **Objective:** Learn deployment strategies.
- **Topics:**
  - Packaging Spring Boot apps as JAR/WAR
  - Dockerizing Spring Boot applications
  - Basic CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions/Jenkins)
- **Resources:**

## **Tips for Effective Learning**

1. **Prioritize Coding:** Spend at least 60% of your study time coding.
2. **Leverage Your Existing Knowledge:** Draw parallels between Laravel, NestJS, and Spring Boot.
3. **Build a Project:** Continuously enhance the inventory system project throughout the roadmap.
4. **Engage with the Community:** Join Spring Boot forums or Stack Overflow for discussions.
5. **Learn Iteratively:** Revisit concepts like DI, Spring Security, or JPA if they feel complex initially.

By the end of this roadmap, you should comfortably reach a mid-level proficiency in Java and Spring Boot.
